## 🛡️ Overview

Nyami is a Python obfuscator that transforms your source code into a protected, unreadable format while maintaining full functionality. Whether you're distributing commercial software, protecting proprietary software, or securing sensitive applications, Nyami provides enterprise-grade protection against code theft and unauthorized analysis.

## ✨ Core Features

### 🔐 **Code Obfuscation**
- **Function Obfuscator** - Encrypts functions
- **Lite Function Obfuscator** - Compresses & marshales functions for smaller files
- **Bytecode Encryption** - Encrypts Python bytecode for better protection
- **String Encryption** - Secures all string literals within your code
- **Import Obfuscator** - Hides and obfuscates module imports
- **Variable Renamer** - Automatically renames variables to meaningless identifiers
- **MBA Obfuscator** - Mixed Boolean-Arithmetic obfuscation for added protection
- **Polymorphic Obfuscator & Encryption** - Dynamic code transformation that changes with each build
- **Multi Layer Encryption** - Multiple layers of protection
- **Control Flow Flattening & Obfuscator** - Obfuscates code by breaking and hiding structure
- **Opaque Predicates** - Inserts always-true or always-false conditions
- **Wrap In Function** - Wraps the whole code in a single function
- **Minifier** - Removes spaces/comments for less memory usage
- **Junk Code Injection** - Injects junk code to confuse Reverse Engineers
- **Number Convertor** - Converts numbers to hex/octal/binary
- **Compress** - Not really obfuscation but makes files smaller
- **Polymorphic Key Derivation** - Key is derived with a different logic each build

### 🔒 **Security Features**
- **HWID Based Encryption** (optional) - Lock your code to specific hardware
- **Integrity Checks** - Detect tampering attempts and unauthorized changes
- **Anti-Debugger Protection** - Defense against Python debuggers and virtual machine detection
- **Import Protection** - Defense against monkey patching.
  
### 🛠️ **Developer Tools**
- **Multiple Python Version Support** - Works across different Python versions
- **Macros** - Macro system for advanced customization
- **Full Documentation** - Complete guides and examples for all features
- **PyInstaller Support** - Easy integration with executable creation
- **Version Check** - Checks the python version and exits the script if its not the same as the build version, it also lets the runner know the right version.
- **Auto Module Install** - Installs all missing modules that the **obfuscator** uses.
- **Script Interconnectivity** - Obfuscated scripts can be used as modules using the macro `__all__`

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### **How many layers of obfuscation are there?**
Our system uses **dynamic layering** - the number changes with each obfuscation, creating a nearly unpredictable output that keeps reverse-engineers guessing!

### **Why is it paid?**
Quality comes at a cost! Our obfuscation process requires **significant resources, and constant updates**. Your support keeps us innovating and the service running smoothly!

### **What are macros?**
Macros are pre-defined functions available after obfuscation. They're optional but useful for **specific implementations**

### **Do you keep any of the obfuscated files or source code?**
**Zero data retention!** Your files are automatically purged after obfuscation. What happens in Nyami, stays in Nyami - your privacy is our priority!

### **What does Nyami mean?**
Nyami combines the Japanese words 'nyx' (night) and 'yami' (darkness)

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **Zero Data Retention** - Files are automatically purged after processing.
- **Secure Processing** - Your code is handled securely during obfuscation.
- **Privacy First** - What happens in Nyami, stays in Nyami.
- **No Permanent Storage** - Files are not kept on our servers after obfuscation.
