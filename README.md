*Advanced Python obfuscation toolkit designed to safeguard your intellectual property and prevent reverse engineering.*

## üõ°Ô∏è Overview

Nyami is a comprehensive Python obfuscation suite that transforms your source code into a protected, unreadable format while maintaining full functionality. Whether you're distributing commercial software, protecting proprietary algorithms, or securing sensitive applications, Nyami provides enterprise-grade protection against code theft and unauthorized analysis.

Our system uses **dynamic layering** - the number of protection layers changes with each obfuscation, creating a nearly unpredictable output that keeps reverse-engineers guessing!

## ‚ú® Core Features

### üîê **Code Obfuscation**
- **Function Encryption** - Secure function definitions with advanced encryption algorithms
- **Bytecode Protection** - Encrypt Python bytecode for enhanced runtime security
- **String Obfuscation** - Encrypt and hide all string literals throughout your codebase
- **Import Masking** - Conceal module imports and dependencies from static analysis
- **Variable Renaming** - Replace meaningful variable names with randomized identifiers
- **Control Flow Flattening** - Restructure code flow to confuse reverse engineering attempts

### üöÄ **Advanced Protection**
- **Mixed Boolean-Arithmetic (MBA)** - Apply mathematical transformations to logical operations
- **Polymorphic Encryption** - Generate unique obfuscated output with each compilation
- **Multi-Layer Security** - Stack multiple protection techniques for maximum security
- **Opaque Predicates** - Insert conditional statements that always evaluate predictably
- **Junk Code Injection** - Add non-functional code segments to mislead analyzers
- **Number Conversion** - Transform numeric literals into hexadecimal, octal, or binary formats

### üîí **Security Hardening**
- **Hardware-Based Locking** - Bind executables to specific hardware configurations (optional)
- **Integrity Verification** - Detect and respond to code tampering attempts
- **Anti-Debug Protection** - Prevent debugging tools and virtual machine analysis
- **Antivirus Evasion** - Advanced obfuscation techniques specifically designed to slip past most antivirus software undetected
- **Import Guard** - Protect against monkey patching and runtime modifications

### üõ†Ô∏è **Developer Tools**
- **Cross-Version Compatibility** - Support for multiple Python versions
- **Macro System** - Pre-defined functions available after obfuscation for optional but useful specific implementations
- **Code Minification** - Remove whitespace and comments to reduce file size
- **Function Wrapping** - Encapsulate entire programs within protective functions
- **PyInstaller Integration** - Seamless compatibility with executable packaging

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### **How many layers of obfuscation are there?**
Our system uses **dynamic layering** - the number changes with each obfuscation, creating a nearly unpredictable output that keeps reverse-engineers guessing!

### **Is it undetected by VirusTotal?**
**Absolutely!** Our advanced obfuscation techniques are specifically designed to slip past most antivirus software undetected

### **Why is it paid?**
Quality comes at a cost! Our obfuscation process requires **significant resources, and constant updates**. Your support keeps us innovating and the service running smoothly!
